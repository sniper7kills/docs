# Requirements

## Knowledge

Multi-tenancy can be really hard to understand, let alone apply in an application. That's why we recommend everybody to first be fluent with Laravel application development before starting with Tenancy.

## Software
Tenancy is always looking to support the latest Laravel version for their packages. This version of Tenancy supports
- Laravel 7.x or higher
- PHP 7.2 or higher

As docs can sometimes be outdated, we highly recommend you to have a look at the most recent [Github Actions](https://github.com/tenancy/tenancy/actions?query=branch%3Amaster).

## Module Specific Requirements

Depending on which Tenancy modules are being used, there may be additional module specific requirements. Be sure to check each module that you are installing to ensure you meet the requirements.
