## Base Installation

There are two methods for getting the base package installed, [Simplified](#simplified-install) and [Selective](#selective-install).

The simplified install method will install the base package and all of the additional modules, but will not register all of the providers.

The selective install method will only install the base package, and each additional module will need to be installed on its own.

We would highly recommend using the selective installation method as it ensure that only the modules you need are installed, and it will automatically register the appropriate providers.

### Simplified Install

For a quick, simplified installation you can install everything at once:

```bash
composer require tenancy/tenancy
```

> CAUTION: This will load specific non-intrusive Affects by default. You can check which are loaded by looking in the `composer.json` of the repository.

This is an easy way of giving this toolkit a spin!

> We recommend selectively installing the packages you need.

After you've installed tenancy/tenancy make sure you register the Affects and Hooks you wish to use. You do this by simply registering the respective Providers.
Here is the non-exhaustive list of providers that can be added to `config/app.php`, make sure you comment out the ones you don't need.
The exact provider needed is included in each component's documentation.

```php
    'providers' => [
         // ...

        /*
         * Package Service Providers...
         */
        Tenancy\Affects\Broadcasts\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Cache\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Configs\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Connections\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Filesystems\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Logs\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Mails\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Models\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Routes\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\URLs\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Affects\Views\Provider::class,

        Tenancy\Hooks\Database\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Hooks\Migration\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Hooks\Hostname\Provider::class,

        Tenancy\Database\Drivers\Mysql\Provider::class,
        Tenancy\Database\Drivers\Sqlite\Provider::class,
         // ...
    ]
```

### Selective Install

Instead of loading all tenancy packages at once, you can selectively install
what you need. You need at least the framework:

```bash
composer require tenancy/framework
```

## Next Steps

Now that the base package is installed you will need to determine what your [tenant object will be](tenant-what-is) and [perform setup of the tenant object(s)](tenant-setup).

After that selectively add and/or configure:

- [Database drivers](database-drivers). Where to allocate tenant information.
- [Lifecycle hooks](hooks-general). Impact your application whenever tenants are created, updated or deleted.
- [Identification drivers](identification-general). Allowing you to configure how your tenant is identified.
- [Affects](affects-general). How your application is modified once a tenant is identified.
