The principles of the database driver is quite similar to the [identification driver][identification-drivers];
the connection resolver dispatches a set of events which allow our database drivers to tell what connection to
set up for the tenants. Yes, you can install multiple database drivers, thus allowing you to use a different
connection per [tenant][tenant-what-is] based on your requirements.
